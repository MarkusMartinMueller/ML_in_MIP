# Aneurysm Detection

Created by Leo Seeger, Markus MÃ¼ller, Ramona Bendias from TU Berlin.

## Introduction

We performed cerebral aneurysm detection and analysis. The data used in the experiments was provided by TU Berlin and the same as provided in the [CADA Challenge](https://cada.grand-challenge.org/). This work can be used for aneurysm detection, segmentation and rupture risk estimation.


## Project Structure

- **[templates](./templates)** (Python): Refactored Notebooks that are reusable for a specific task (e.g. model training, data exploration). Notebooks should be refactored, documented, not contain any output, and use the following naming schema: `short-description`. If you like to make use of a template Notebook, duplicate the notebook into `develop` folder.
- **[utils](./utils)**: Utility functions that are distilled from the research phase and used across multiple notebooks/scripts. Should only contain refactored and tested Python scripts/modules. Installable via pip from project folder: `pip install -e ./utils`.
